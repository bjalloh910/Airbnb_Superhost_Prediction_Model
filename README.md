# Airbnb_Superhost_Prediction_Model
This repository contains a project focused on predicting whether an Airbnb host is a 'super host' using a preprocessed dataset, airbnbData_train. The goal is to train a supervised machine learning model to perform binary classification, predicting the values in the host_is_superhost column (True or False).
